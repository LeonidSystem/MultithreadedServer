Example of TCP-Multithreaded server. In this example, the threads take the tasks from the queue. The tasks can be anything, such as message output or data encryption (crypto++). Adding tasks is protected by a spinlock, and threads are notified via a conditional variable.

Boot: g++ main.cpp Server/Server.cpp Spinlock/Spinlock.cpp ThreadPool/ThreadPool.cpp -lpthread -lcrypto++ -o main
